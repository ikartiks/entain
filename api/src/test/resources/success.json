Has started two times at this course and distance and is yet to miss the placings. Nicely placed to go a couple better. HAKUSAN ALTAIR (3) fought on for second last start over 1500m at this track to add to some fine recent form. Nicely placed to give this a mighty shake."},"venue_id":"0218fe84-9144-4c28-81ca-9b8647007d56","venue_name":"Nagoya","venue_state":"JPN","venue_country":"JPN"},"de536a15-e43a-4baf-beca-468b0c5cbdbd":{"race_id":"de536a15-e43a-4baf-beca-468b0c5cbdbd","race_name":"Hyland Race Colours (Bm72)","race_number":7,"meeting_id":"097f6b98-9b85-4c3b-8957-ebfeba2ea51e","meeting_name":"Canterbury","category_id":"4a2788f8-e825-4d36-9894-efd4baf1cfae","advertised_start":{"seconds":1690352400},"race_form":{"distance":1550,"distance_type":{"id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","name":"Metres","short_name":"m"},"distance_type_id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","track_condition":{"id":"066119d8-3b74-11e8-a5eb-06a5c6d9a756","name":"Soft5","short_name":"soft5"},"track_condition_id":"066119d8-3b74-11e8-a5eb-06a5c6d9a756","weather":{"id":"08e5f78c-1a36-11eb-9269-cef03e67f1a3","name":"FINE","short_name":"fine","icon_uri":"FINE"},"weather_id":"08e5f78c-1a36-11eb-9269-cef03e67f1a3","race_comment":"LITTLE BEGINNINGS (4) was in flying form prior to last start when tackling Saturday grade, finishing last of seven, albeit only beaten 2.25 lengths.
